<h2><span style="color:#00ccff">How did it start?</span></h2>

<p>After attending the online <strong>Flutter Engage</strong> event 💙 I got so excited about the Flutter web stable release and I thought it&#39;s time to make something cool using it 👨&zwj;💻. I&#39;ve already tested the beta Flutter web release when it was announced but there wasn&#39;t official support and maintenance of flutter web plugins back then.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve started brainstorming and brainstorming and .... Nothing! 😬 I couldn&#39;t come up with any good idea. Throw the project to the bottom of the backlog.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was watching a video on the Flutter Dev youtube channel&nbsp; 📺 about <strong>Draggable Widget</strong> and I thought it would be cool to make Draggable apps inside the main app. So I&#39;ve started working on that and after few hours I got the first dirty prototype working. Then I&#39;ve started thinking: Why not turn it into an OS like User Interface. And here we are! 😎🤩</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t my main focus to make an innovative design 🤷&zwj;️ ... I was just trying to test how far I can push my technical knowledge and coding skills on getting something that works.</p>

<p>While implementing the UI I got inspiration from MacOS (The OS I am currently using), Ubuntu. and I also added some <strong>Windows XP flavor</strong> 🤪.</p>

<p>I got some help from <a href="https://www.artstation.com/montassar-faidi">my little brother</a>&nbsp;👶, who is a <strong>graphic designer</strong>, to design a new background and some unique icons.</p>
